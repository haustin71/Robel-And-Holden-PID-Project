# PID Line Following Car
For our second project we decided to create a car that uses PID to run on a track made out of tape. The car uses IR sensors to detect the color of the tape, and it will follow the tape and correct itself when taking turns.

Overall, we think taht this project went very well because we ended up finishing it. Our last project wasn't finished because we didn't manage our time. We learned from our mistakes that we made on the last project
