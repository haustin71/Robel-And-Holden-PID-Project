# PID Line Following Car
For our second project we decided to create a car that uses PID to run on a track made out of tape. The car uses IR sensors to detect the color of the tape, and it will follow the tape and correct itself when taking turns.

Overall, we think that this project went very well because we ended up finishing it. Our last project wasn't finished because we didn't manage our time. We learned from our mistakes that we made on the last project. Unfortunately, we had finished code that worked but we couldn't tune it to get the robot to actually follow a line. The robot is fully finished with it working it's just that the hardest part was getting the 4 IR sensors to detect the line.
